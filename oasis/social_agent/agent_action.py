                whose warrant is being challenged.
            rating (int): The rating to give. Use an integer in the range
                [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], where -2 means very bad, -1 means bad, 0
                means neutral, 1 means good, and 2 means very good.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary with two key-value pairs. The 'success' key
                maps to a boolean indicating whether the challenge was
                successful. The 'challenge_id' key maps to the integer ID of
                the newly created challenge record.

            Example of a successful return:
            {"success": True, "challenge_id": 789}

        Note:
            This action can only be performed on transactions that included a
            truth warrant. Attempting to challenge a transaction without a
            warrant will result in a failure.
