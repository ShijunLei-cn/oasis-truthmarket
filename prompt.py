## Production & Selling
- **High quality (HQ) products** cost more to produce but generate higher profits (3 points) than low quality products
- **Low quality (LQ) products** cost less to produce but generate lower profits (2 points)
- You may **advertise any quality regardless of your actual product quality**

- You can **exit and re-enter the market** to reset your reputation:
